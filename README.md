## about me
when I was a child I dreamed about building robots so I joined a univerity in Algeria to follow my childhood dream, but when I was at the university a new era of smartphones began so I told myself I should do this after my graduation.

just after my graduation from *USTHB* as a robotics engineer, I started my journey as an **Android developer** using **Java** but after one year I switched to **Kotlin**, a couple of years later I discovered **Flutter** which is a powerful tool to build cross-platform apps.

in my projects, I follow the *clean architecture* approach combining it with a different pattern such as **MVVM**, **MVP** & **MVI**, or even **Bloc** pattern (for flutter projects) for Dependency injection I use **Dager/Hilt** for android and **Getit** for Flutter projects.
